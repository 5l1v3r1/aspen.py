    ~~VERSION~~ -- ~~DATE~~
========================================

This is the first release of Aspen. This is alpha-quality software, and this
release is aimed at Python web enthusiasts. Aspen represents the culmination of
about two years of design and development effort. This is my best attempt at a
system for building and deploying many highly heterogenous websites.
